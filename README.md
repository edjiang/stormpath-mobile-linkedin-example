# Stormpath Mobile LinkedIn Sign-In Example

This is an example to show how to sign into LinkedIn on mobile via deep linking.

Since LinkedIn's mobile SDKs don't support [using the access token on the server](https://developer.linkedin.com/docs/ios-sdk-auth) or logging in without the LinkedIn app, I whipped up this demo to show how to do LinkedIn login through Stormpath.
